# Hi, I'm Ryan

I build reliable distributed systems and platform infrastructure that teams depend on. Currently working on cloud-native platform engineering at IBM Quantum, where I focus on mission-critical services, CI/CD, observability, and compliance-driven infrastructure.

## What I'm Working On

I spend most of my time building and operating distributed microservices on Kubernetes, with a focus on reliability, observability, and developer experience. This includes designing CI/CD pipelines, implementing SRE practices, and ensuring services meet production-grade standards for security and compliance.

## Technical Interests

- **Distributed Systems:** Microservices architecture, service boundaries, and inter-service communication patterns
- **Platform Engineering:** CI/CD, infrastructure as code, developer tooling, and platform reliability
- **Observability & SRE:** Distributed tracing, metrics, monitoring, incident response, and disaster recovery
- **Cloud-Native Infrastructure:** Kubernetes, containerization, and cloud platform services

## Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:**
`Go` `TypeScript` `JavaScript` `Node.js` `Python`, `NestJS`, `Next.js`, `React.js`

**Infrastructure & DevOps:**
`Kubernetes` `Docker` `ArgoCD` `Helm` `Terraform` `CI/CD`

**Databases & Storage:**
`PostgreSQL` `Redis` `Object Storage (S3-compatible)`

**Messaging & Communication:**
`NATS` `REST APIs` `WebSockets`

**Observability:**
`OpenTelemetry` `Prometheus` `Grafana` `Jaeger`

**Cloud Platforms:**
`IBM Cloud` `Heroku` `Firebase`

## Currently Learning

Exploring site reliability readiness and software system fault-tolerance design patterns. Always interested in learning about production-grade reliability engineering and platform architecture at scale.

## Background

Previously founded and built a subscription-based donation platform, which gave me end-to-end ownership experience—from architecture decisions to production operations. That experience reinforced the importance of clean abstractions, operational rigor, and building systems that are maintainable long-term.

## Get in Touch

Open to collaboration on interesting projects, especially around distributed systems, platform engineering, or open source infrastructure work. Feel free to reach out via GitHub or LinkedIn.
